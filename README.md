# Scraping Amazon Products

This project consistis scraping Amazon Products through a keyword informed by user showing the title, rating, reviews and image of each item obtained.
For the construction I used NodeJS, Axios, JSDOM and Express at back end, testing at Insomnia. And basically used HTML, CSS and JS in the display.

To run this, clone de repo and run the command in WS folder

```
npm install

```
Start the server

```
npm start
```
Open your HTML local file and fetch for a product. Sometimes Amazon blocks the request, but doing it repetitively you can do it.
